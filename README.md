Node Game
=========

##Proof of Concept Node Game

This is my own way of checking out [Socket.io](http://socket.io) with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org).. Just a basic **tic-tac-toe** game played over the network that will wait for turns and display a winner.

Still need to handle a lot of things:
+ restart after win
+ let there be more than one team
+ randomly assign who goes first
+ handle cat's game
+ work on remembering where the player was if they disconnect and come back
+ I have mongodb in here just in case I wanna use it
+ probably going to try mocha for tests -- not good at tests though (something to learn)
+ I'm sure there's a ton more..

Definitely need to learn more about sockets
